Today is indeed a great day

It started with a normal breakfast - cereals and milk like always - followed by checking Reddit and Twitter, appart from the new messages in Telegram and Whatsapp. After that, I went out to do some exercise, but it was too hot outside. I did the cleaning and now I'm here writing this post and continuing the Jekyll Tutorial.
